This project analyzes molecular solubility using SMILES representations of chemical compounds. I preprocess the data with RDKit to extract molecular fingerprints and graph-based features. I implement various machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict aqueous solubility. The project includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model evaluation, and performance comparison. The goal is to develop accurate predictive models that capture molecular properties influencing solubility, useful for drug discovery and chemical research.
